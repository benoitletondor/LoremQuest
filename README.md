# LoremQuest: A 2D RPG game made for browsers

This project is an early work in progress of a tiny game made for web browsers using WebGL.

Currently the game is not even started so don't expect to find anything interesting yet.

## Idea

This is a rpg game with old-fashioned 2D graphics without perspective. I wanted to build a game using my own Dart game framework: [LevelUp](https://github.com/benoitletondor/LevelUp).

## Work in progress

Nothing finished here, not even really started so if you came here to play a game, you're in the wrong place.
